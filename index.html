    A childhood is a period of time from birth to puberty.
    For me it was the most fun and peaceful time.
    <p>You can never take my smile away.
       I will never forget all the memories I made.</p>

        I loved taking pictures. 
        There was never a situation where I didn't pose for a camera.
        <p>Pictures are great because they can capture moments on a piece of paper.
            When I look back at them it feels my heart with joy.</p>

        In this video my mother acted like she would take a picture from me 
        but in reality she filmed me. 
        This is me, little nicole smiling with one side of her mouth.
        <p>A real smile is more worth than anything.</p>
